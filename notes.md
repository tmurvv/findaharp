- Buyers Guide notes from Rachael. 
-- The harp guide is looking good! You've included some information that I hadn't thought of, though on the other hand I was sort of thinking about it being more of a guide on dos and don'ts. To give some lists of really important questions to ask the sellers before you decide to buy from them. Like the age of the harp, maybe a list of common damage that harps experience. Even the most honest seller may not have looked closely enough at their harp or forgotten about some quirk it has because it has become so familiar over the years to them. I'm hoping we can help our buyers to be armed with lots of sensible questions that they may not think of by themselves. Like the soundboard starting to bow upwards, cracks on the soundboard that can only be seen from inside the instrument, age of the instrument, how frequently it's been played, how frequently it's been regulated, the typical relative humidity it has been kept at, if it has ever had any repair work done on it, if it has ever been appraised, what brand of levers are being used, asking for more photographs from all sorts of angles especially the crown (which is typically so high up it's harder to see) and across the soundboard to demonstrate no bowing. Those are just the ones that I can think of off the top of my head sat here.
