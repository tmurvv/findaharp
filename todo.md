### internal
- make it easier to change api on deployment
- check do we need to pass all open/close functions to Product
- make addPlaceholders remove any placeholders that may be there already

### UI/UX
- search on Allegro 26 gold shows allegro 26, which is not gold
- if on the model menu, you accidentally click on the line between the listings, it comes up [object, Object]
- cherry nino not showing when under $2000 selected
- on mobile, open menu pushes down other buttons
- Responsive for login page, detail, contact, not yet implemented 
- contact & verify pages need spinner when submit button pressed
- broken harp image needs image not found
- make button gradient consistent once we hear back from Rachael
- From Rachael, I feel that there should be a way for the user to flick back and forth between the form and the harp information, and without losing anything that they've already typed in if possible. Right now if one clicks on "Contact Seller" the only way to look at the full harp information again is to close the form and click on the harp again. 

### AUTHENTICATION
- Remember me, 
- forgot password on login
- signout
- check on encryption for signup password (does it show up in devtools console upon submit when no localhost used)

### PERFORMANCE
- cache images

### TESTING

- finish writing tests for helper file

### FUTURE IDEAS:

- implement email text communication through website
- CRUD operations on upload listings
- add close form to private listings
- New Listings Page
