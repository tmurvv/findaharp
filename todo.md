### FUTURE IDEAS:

- on mobile menu highlight, put in fancy corners
- New Listings Page
- From Rachael, I feel that there should be a way for the user to flick back and forth between the form and the harp information, and without losing anything that they've already typed in if possible. Right now if one clicks on "Contact Seller" the only way to look at the full harp information again is to close the form and click on the harp again.
