### internal
- make it easier to change api on deployment
- check do we need to pass all open/close functions to Product
- make addPlaceholders remove any placeholders that may be there already

### UI/UX
- model menu click on line, comes up [object, Object]
- cherry nino not showing when under $2000 selected
- Responsive for login page
- contact & verify pages need spinner
- broken harp image needs image not found
- Open only one menu at a time
- Run add filler program on window resize
- get last line of product container to not justify. See old code (search on useEffect)

### AUTHENTICATION
- Remember me, 
- forgot password on login
- signout
- check on encryption for signup password (does it show up in devtools console upon submit when no localhost used)

### PERFORMANCE
- cache images

### TESTING
