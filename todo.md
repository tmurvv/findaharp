- select by size small lever and lever-free need to be tested, no harps currently matching (add some to harptisha site)
- make it so when harp not found generic harp photo shows
- finish writing tests for helper file
- get list to show harps randomly
- convert css files to jsx
- make it so when on pedal radio, only pedal models show in model list
- CRUD operations on upload listings
