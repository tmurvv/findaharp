### internal
- make it easier to change api on deployment

### UI/UX
- Only one menu open at a time
- Add search parameters above harp listings
- Open close all menus, only one menu open at a time?
- Responsive for login page
- contact & verify pages need spinner
- broken harp image needs image not found

### AUTHENTICATION
- Remember me, 
- forgot password on login
- signout
- check on encryption for signup password (does it show up in devtools console upon submit when no localhost used)

### TESTING
